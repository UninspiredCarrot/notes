#FMD

My priorities as of 19th May 2025:
1. Pranavi has to get A in biology
2. TNG internship
3. Self Study for Badminton Analysis
4. Interview Prep for later this year
5. Driverless Simulator
6. GATE Prep

Things I should probably do at some point:
- taxes
- post on Linkedin
	- reach out to people who are doing what i want to do
	- cringe blog posts such as what i learned, literature review, what i've been up to
- personal site
- literature review

My general outlook at the moment:
- I've got a massive fucking loan on my back
- I really don't want to rot at a big bank
- FAANG's abstractions will sicken me, I need something new and quick moving
- Research might be the way but no money and lack of academic prestige
- Got to self study and see where it takes me - learn in public somehow
- I need money + meaning + away from parents
- I need to stop fucking pleasing people -  I am my own person with my own wants and ambitions
